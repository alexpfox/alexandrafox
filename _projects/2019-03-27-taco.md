I made a leather toiletry taco. I put my toothbrush in it when I travel.

The pattern is from [this etsy post](https://www.etsy.com/listing/237681901/the-taco-clutch-felt-or-leather-zip?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=taco+clutch&ref=sr_gallery-1-3&organic_search_click=1).

This was very easy to put together, it only took about a day. I would definitely recommend for anyone's first leather project.

I was careful to mark, punch pin and sew in that order - pinning through the punched sewing holes meant there wasn't any additional or unnecessary marring of the leather's surface or integrity near the seam.

Overall I'm quite pleased with this for being such a short project.
