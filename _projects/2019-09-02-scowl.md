I had a bunch of scrap fabric to use up and a BabyLock serger machine to learn to use, so I made a scarf I could wear as a layer inside the Thunderdome (DeathGuild, the Burning Man camp I camp with every year, brings an interactive Thunderdome straight out of the Mad Max movie.)

It has hidden pockets. I call it a Scowl, something between a scarf and a cowl. I'm happy with this one.
