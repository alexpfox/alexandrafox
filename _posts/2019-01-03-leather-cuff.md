It's funny how the momentum of getting something done can lead to getting even more done than you set out to do. I was recently chatting with a friend about how recognizing the little wins can lead to a lot of positive inertia and definitely found that true this evening. I finished up my 3-week vacation/study break strong today with all of my Metis prework complete and committed, my first post written and posted, a whole bunch of little website bugs fixed and tidied, and ended up with still more energy snd no remaining direction.

Where to turn? My to-do list had two items remaining, but one was too large a project for an evening. I've had an idea for a leather cuff for my Apple Watch sitting in the back of my head for a bit though, so decided to try that remaining option. I thought this was a stretch goal when I wrote it down so I'm already clocking another win for just trying it out today.

It went well, I think:

I quite like the closure design and how that came together with a perfect fit. I also like that it only took 2 hours, half of which was spent burnishing and finishing.

Finished with a bit of white mineral oil (butcher block oil), because I'd like it to pick up character with use. This was intended to be a rough draft version but I think I'll stick with it for a bit, it looks so nice.
